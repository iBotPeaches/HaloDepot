# Halo Depot

I'm tired of mod links dying. I'm tired of a too many sites making it difficult to find good creative mods. So this is
Halo Depot. So this website serves a point to support patch formats that have additional metadata that can produce
a screenshot and description of mod. This can be stored, indexed and made available legally.

## Supported Patches

 * Halo 2 era patches (`.serenity`)
 
## Patch Requirements

 In order for a patch format to be added to Halo Depot, it must have some additional metadata that can be used to
 extract information like - Name of mod, image of mod and author name. Those are MINIMUM requirements. Anything else 
 just is not worth it - as it requires too much additional input from the end user.
 
 The goal for Halo Depot is to be simple - Upload patch & good to go.

## License

 It is behind an MIT license because GitHub wants me to pick one. You can do anything with it inline with that license.
 If you are a Bungie or 343 or some 3rd party that produced/worked on any Halo game - you are allowed to do whatever
 you want.
